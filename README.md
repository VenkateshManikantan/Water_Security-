## Summary
There is no exam for this course, instead a project has to be handed in. The project involves a data analytics assignment. The projects are assigned (randomly) to the different teams :
*	Water Security
*	Uncovering the network
*	Politicians and Climate Change
*	Heat Waves Impacts
*	ECB Bond Purchases
* Cities and Greenhouse Gas Emissions

Each of the projects are described in detail in the appendices of this document. 

## Open Research Questions
The research questions are really "open". In other words: these are just a start. The same holds for the initial dataset. By no means are you restricted by the suggested data. On the contrary, a good data-scientist is capable to "think out of the box" and to retrieve data from other sources and blend these together.

The teaching team would be sad, if the only thing you achieved in our course, is producing a vanilla Jupyter Notebook where you make us some standard charts. With this course, you should have advanced much further on the learning curve.

# Topic
**Water Security**

Introduction
The current climate change scenario predicts that almost half of the worldâ€™s population will live in areas of high water stress by 2050 with limited access to fresh clean water. Governments, national, and international institutions, as well as water management companies, are looking for solutions that can address this growing global water demand. Cities are encouraged to take action on water security, to build resilience to water scarcity and manage this finite resource for the future. 

Proposed Research Question
Are all cities reporting consistent data ? Are there data gaps in some regions ? Can you predict the likelihood of a water shortage ? What about the population densities in those areas ?

Initial Data Set
The place to start your enquiry is (data.cdp.net and www.cdp.net). The climate disclosure panel (CDP) is a not-for-profit charity that runs the global disclosure system for investors, companies, cities, states and regions to manage their environmental impacts. The data for cities and regions is free for access & downloading.
